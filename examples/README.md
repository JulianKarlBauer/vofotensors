# Examples

Python scripts (.py) are the original source
but are converted to
Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) based on `Makefile`.

Both scripts and notebooks are version controlled.
Please use what you like better.
The examples can, e.g., be run online in notebook format [here with binder][url_binder].
